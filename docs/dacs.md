Tutorial: Launching Your Own DAC on the Jungle Test Network with eosDAC

The future is decentralized. Lasting value will be created and maintained by communities and their network effect. Centralized hierarchies controlled by the unelected will increasingly be seen as an old, rigid model compared to dyanmic entities where everyone with skin in the game has a voice and those who create value are rewarded according to the consensus of the community expressed through elected custodians.

This is what eosDAC is working to build.
